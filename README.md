### Hi there 👋 I am Rishav Kumar Paramhans

As a M.Sc.Eng. student at University of Siegen, I have specialized in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My passion lies in developing AI-based cutting-edge technology. I am commited to continous learning and am currently enagaged in various activites to enchance my knoweldge in the above mentioned fields, including taking up new projects, reading industry publications and collaborating with colleagues.  

* 🌍 I'm based in Dresden,Germany
* 🔭 I’m currently working on Inteligent Perecption Functions for Autonomous Driving at IAV GmBH, Dresden
* ✉️ You can contact me at rishavkrparamahns@gmail.com
* 🧠 I'm learning more in PyTorch and TensorFlow as frameworks. 

### Here's the list of my recent repositories:
* Multi-Task Network for autononous Driving: Capable of simaltanously performing Monocular 3D Object Detection, 2D Object Detection, Monocular Depth Estimation and 
                                             Semantic Segmentation
* Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation
* Pointnet: 3D Object Classification, Semantic and Part Segmentation on 3D Point Clouds.
* Image Classification
* Pick and Place Operation on Lego Mindstrom EV3 Manipulator robot.
